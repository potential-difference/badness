TODO wednesday night

understand all the .mds 
translate them to json
make json a source of truth

handle:
  rig placements
  pixelmappings 


user story:
  move half of megaseeda and megaseedb into another rig

Other tasks:
    rig for booth etc
    anims that dont depend on beats

    (beat class)

Rich Requests:
   presses E and prints pixel positions
   what would be handy would be
   press Q, get white dot to light up a pixel
   wants: name on screen. e.g. SmallShieldC ShieldsOPCGrid.name
   look at coordinatesInfo in sketch_info.pde line 117
   //thing to look for is opc map
   //i.e. rig.opcgrid
   //answer: no. spaghetti inside OPC_GRID

2: //booth rig simple anims

NOTES:
   SizeSettings is our encapsulation of where all the rigs go
   what bits of SizeSettings() do you modify to move rigs about?
   'size' contains SizeSettings
   and we use it to get the positions of each rig
   by name :/ 

   wled config.json | jq '.hw.led.ins[] | {start,len}' looks like:
    {
        "start": 0,
        "len": 1
    }
    {
        ""
    }

Getting distracted. dmxSmoke is an Anim and should be refactored as such

Making keybindings.json - documentation(at least) of keybindings
  if they just call a function, this can be code gen.

instead of passing BoothGrid opcGrid into dmxSmoke (though i like the type safety)
it's a always-on anim
plus debug printlns
