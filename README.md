### branching:
to create this branch i typed:
```
$git branch benjaminsbranch
$git checkout benjaminsbranch
```
this created the branch locally
then i edited this file, and finally
```
$git add README.md
```
tell git to use new version of README in this branch
```
$git commit -m "edited README with branching info"
$git push origin benjaminsbranch
```
that last bit pushes the local branch to the git server under a new name.
that new name DOES NOT need to be the same as the local branch name.
